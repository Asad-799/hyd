        <li>Bakrid, also known as Eid-ul-Zuha or Eid al-Adha, commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son Ismail as an act of obedience to Allah. However, Allah replaced Ismail with a ram, symbolizing that the sacrifice was a test of faith. This story is central to the festival's meaning of sacrifice and devotion</li>
        <li>On Bakrid, Muslims sacrifice an animal such as a goat, lamb, or cow. The meat from the sacrifice is divided into three parts: one-third for the poor and needy, one-third for relatives and friends, and one-third kept for the family. This sharing emphasizes charity and community support</li>
        <li>The festival is observed on the 10th day of the Islamic month of Zul-Hijja. Devotees wear new clothes, offer special prayers at mosques after sunrise, and celebrate with family gatherings and feasting. Traditional meat dishes and sweets are prepared, and the event fosters social bonds and joy among Muslims worldwide</li>

            <li>The day is observed with prayers, religious gatherings, processions, and recitations about the life and teachings of Prophet Muhammad, emphasizing his messages of peace, compassion, and charity</li>
            <li>Homes, mosques, and streets are decorated with lights and green flags, and people share sweets and perform acts of charity, reflecting the Prophetâ€™s values of generosity and kindness</li>
